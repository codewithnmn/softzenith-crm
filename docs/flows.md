# CRM flows (Phase 1)

> Generated from one source together with the shareable page. Diagrams are Mermaid: they render on GitHub and in VS Code.

How the CRM is built and how it behaves: the architecture (apps, modules, request path, tenancy, data), who can do what, exactly what happens step by step when someone submits an enquiry, signs in, assigns a lead or changes its status, and how to debug any of it from a request id down to the line of code. Every flow is the same for every tenant; a tenant only changes data (settings, roles, branches), never the flow.

## Legend

- **Rounded box**: where a flow starts or ends
- **Rectangle**: a step the system performs
- **Diamond**: a decision or check
- **Dotted arrow**: happens later, in the background, after the database commit
- **Circle**: an actor (a person) in use-case diagrams
- **Stadium**: a use case (something an actor can do)
- **Sequence diagram**: messages between parts of the system, top to bottom in time

### System at a glance

Three web apps and one API. Staff use the CRM app; the public uses the CRM's own enquiry page or a tenant's website (Western World runs on its own domain). Browsers never call the API directly: each Next.js server forwards `/api` calls to it, and the Western World site forwards only the two public enquiry endpoints. The API is one Spring Boot application split into modules, over one PostgreSQL schema where every tenant row carries `tenant_id`.

```mermaid

<a id="arch-modules"></a>
### Backend modules and how they talk

Each folder under `com.softzenith.crm` is a module that owns its tables. A module may call another module's public classes (solid arrows) but never its repositories; `ModularityTests` fails the build if that rule is broken. The lead module never calls notification: it publishes events, which are stored with the lead in the same transaction and delivered after commit (dotted arrow). `shared` is open to every module.

<a id="arch-pipeline"></a>
### The path of one API request

The same fixed order for every call. The first filter gives the request an id, which appears on every log line and in every error body, and follows the work into the background notification thread. Anything that goes wrong becomes an RFC 9457 problem response in one place, `GlobalExceptionHandler`.

<a id="arch-tenancy"></a>
### How tenants are kept apart

Tenant isolation does not rely on developers remembering a where-clause. Whoever handles the work puts the tenant in `TenantContext` (a per-thread value); Hibernate reads it and stamps or filters `tenant_id` on every entity that extends `TenantScopedEntity`. If nothing set it, queries return nothing and inserts fail.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph WHO["Who sets the tenant"]
    direction TB
    W1["Staff request:<br/>StaffContextFilter, from X-Tenant-ID"]
    W2["Public enquiry:<br/>TenantContext.call, tenant found by slug"]

    W4["Onboarding, sign-in lookup:<br/>TenantContext.callAsSystem, sees all tenants"]
  end

  R --> N["Nothing set: queries see nothing,<br/>inserts fail. Safe by default"]

```

*Where in the code:* `shared/tenant/TenantContext · shared/tenant/HibernateTenancyConfig · shared/persistence/TenantScopedEntity`

<a id="arch-data"></a>
### Data model

Tables as the Flyway migrations V1 to V7 create them (V7 only changes the seeded roles' data scope; the planned Student table is described under 'Converting a lead to a student') (`ddl-auto=validate`: the app refuses to start if an entity and the schema disagree). Tables owned by a tenant also carry `tenant_id`, audit columns (`created_at/by`, `updated_at/by`) and `version` for optimistic locking. One open lead per person: unique on (tenant, phone, email) while the lead is not CLOSED.

### One website enquiry, end to end

What happens between a visitor pressing Submit on the Western World site and the emails going out. The visitor gets the thank-you as soon as the database commits; messages follow on a background thread carrying the same request id, so the whole story can be read back from the log.

```mermaid

<a id="arch-frontends"></a>
### The two front-end apps

Both are Next.js 16 apps with client-side pages. The staff app builds its menu from the signed-in user's permissions and calls the API through a client whose types are generated from the backend's OpenAPI spec (`npm run gen:api`). Tenant websites live in their own repositories (Western World: `codewithnmn/westernworld-website`): content pages, one enquiry form component used everywhere, redirects that keep every old URL working, and the public enquiry API as their only link to the CRM.

### Onboarding a new business (tenant)

The golden rule: a new business needs data, not code. Onboarding creates the tenant and its default roles in one transaction; everything that differs between businesses is stored as tenant settings. Settings and tenant creation have no admin screen yet (planned); today they are done by the seeder or directly.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A(["New business"]) --> B["Create tenant<br/>slug, name, phone region, timezone"]
  B --> C["Create 4 default roles<br/>with their permissions"]
  C --> D["Tenant settings, stored as data:<br/>lead number prefix, form options,<br/>email sender name, welcome on/off"]
  D --> E["Admin adds branches<br/>and staff"]
  E --> F(["Enquiry form live at<br/>/enquiry/slug"])
```

## Use cases

<a id="uc-capture"></a>
### Use cases: capturing leads

Leads come in from the public form or are entered by staff. Both go through the same intake, so duplicate detection, numbering and notifications are identical.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  visitor(("Visitor /<br/>student"))
  staff(("Any staff<br/>member"))
  subgraph CRM["CRM: lead capture"]
    direction TB
    u1(["Open enquiry form"])
    u2(["Submit enquiry"])
    u3(["Add walk-in / phone /<br/>referral lead"])
    u4(["Detect repeat enquiry<br/>and attach to open lead"])
    u5(["Receive welcome email"])
    u6(["Receive welcome WhatsApp<br/>(demo)"])
  end
  visitor --- u1 & u2 & u5 & u6
  staff --- u3
  u2 -.->|"includes"| u4
  u3 -.->|"includes"| u4
```

*Where in the code:* `lead/web/PublicEnquiryController.java · lead/web/LeadController.java · lead/LeadService.intake`

<a id="uc-handling"></a>
### Use cases: working leads

What a role sees follows its data scope: Admin and Receptionist ALL, Branch Manager BRANCH (own branch + assigned to them), Counsellor OWN (assigned to them); other leads answer 404. A lead a counsellor adds stays unassigned until reception or an admin assigns it. Receptionists and admins assign; admins and counsellors change status; only admins reopen and see the dashboard. Every action is written to the lead's history, and the student is told (email + WhatsApp) when the lead is assigned or its status changes. Planned (S1, not built yet): the counsellor converts a qualified lead into a Student, and the follow-up work moves there.

<a id="uc-admin"></a>
### Use cases: administration

Admins onboard staff by mobile number and keep basic employee records. The staff member activates their own account by signing in with that number.

## Flows

<a id="flow-journey"></a>
### The customer journey: enquiry, lead, student

The big picture. A Lead is an enquiry that is not yet qualified; it is assigned to a counsellor, who contacts and qualifies it. A lead ends in one of two ways: it is converted into a Student when the person decides to go ahead, or it is closed as lost, with a reason. Assignment does not end a lead. From conversion on, all the real work (follow-ups, tasks, remarks, documents, applications, the visa case) belongs to the Student. Student is the Western World name for a generic Contact, so other businesses can call it Client or Customer. Dashed boxes are planned: Student and conversion (S1), then remarks and tasks (C1 to C3), documents (DOC1, DOC2), and applications and visa (PRD phase 4).

<a id="flow-enquiry"></a>
### Submitting an enquiry

Everything up to "Commit" happens in one database transaction on the request thread. The lead and the "notify about it" event are saved together, or not at all. Notifications run afterwards (next diagram), so the visitor never waits for email.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A(["Visitor clicks Submit"]) --> B["Browser sends POST<br/>/api/v1/public/tenants/slug/enquiries"]

```

*Where in the code:* `frontend/app/enquiry/[tenant]/page.tsx · lead/web/PublicEnquiryController.submit · lead/LeadService.intake · tenancy/TenantCounters.next`

<a id="flow-walkin"></a>
### Staff adding a walk-in or phone lead

Same intake as the public form. The only differences: the tenant comes from the signed-in user, the source is chosen by staff, and created_by records who entered it.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A(["Staff clicks + Add lead"]) --> B["Fills name, mobile, source<br/>WALK_IN / PHONE / REFERRAL / OTHER"]

  F -.->|"background"| H[["Notifications flow"]]
```

*Where in the code:* `frontend/app/(staff)/leads/page.tsx (AddLead) · lead/web/LeadController.create`

<a id="flow-notify"></a>
### Notifications after a new lead

Runs on a background thread once the lead is committed. One failed recipient never stops the others. Every attempt, whatever the result, is written to notification_log and shown on the lead page. If the app crashes halfway, the event is re-sent on the next start; messages already delivered for that event are skipped. The enquirer's welcome only repeats service/country values from the tenant's form options, and at most enquirer-daily-cap messages of one kind go to one address per day (the rest are logged SKIPPED). Completed events are deleted from event_publication.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

```

*Where in the code:* `notification/LeadNotifications.java · notification/Notifier.java · resources/templates/notifications/*.mustache`

<a id="flow-student-updates"></a>
### Keeping the student informed, and repeat enquiries

Messages to the enquirer after the welcome, all following the tenant setting notifications.studentUpdates (default on). Staff wording is never forwarded: the close reason stays internal. A repeat enquiry alerts the counsellor who owns the lead, or the new-lead alert staff when nobody does. (Feed @mentions of the student arrive with the Phase 3 feed.)

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A1(["LeadAssigned"]) --> S1["Student: 'X is now your counsellor'"]

### Signing in

Production uses Supabase phone OTP; development uses a backend dev login with no OTP. Both give a token with the same shape, so everything after that is identical. A sign-in proven by an OTP (token amr) links every open invite for that phone, also on later sign-ins (e.g. a second business invites the same person). Dev login refuses to start with the prod profile.

<a id="flow-request"></a>
### Every staff request (the common pipeline)

Every screen after sign-in goes through these checks. Role and permissions are read from the database on each request, so a role change applies immediately. The tenant filter means a query can never return another business's data, even if code forgets to check.

<a id="flow-scope"></a>
### Which leads a user can see (data scope)

Each role has a data scope. The lead list is filtered by it, and every action that loads one lead (open, edit, status, assign, history, messages) uses the same check, answering 404 so a user cannot even learn that a lead outside their scope exists. Seeded roles (owner, 26 Sep 2026; V7): Admin and Receptionist ALL, Branch Manager BRANCH, Counsellor OWN; a tenant changes them in roles.data_scope. A new enquiry is always recorded whatever the scope of the staff member entering it; a lead a counsellor adds stays unassigned until reception or an admin assigns it.

```mermaid

<a id="flow-assign"></a>
### Assigning a lead to a counsellor

Admins and receptionists can assign (LEAD_ASSIGN). Only staff whose role is marked assignable appear in the list (by default Counsellor and Branch Manager; the dev demo tenant also made its Super Admin assignable, as tenant data). Reassigning works the same way and keeps the history. Assignment does not end the lead: the counsellor works it until it is converted to a student or closed as lost.

### Onboarding a business (SoftZenith console)

A SoftZenith platform admin signs in at /platform with a username and password (a separate identity from tenant staff, with its own token and filter chain) and fills in the onboarding form. The preview runs the whole setup in a transaction and rolls it back, so a ready preview will go live. Going live creates everything in one transaction. Runbook: docs/onboarding.md.

### Changing status, closing and reopening

Admins and counsellors change status (LEAD_CHANGE_STATUS). ASSIGNED is never set here (use Assign). Closing means the enquiry is lost (not interested, unreachable, ...) and needs a reason; reopening a closed lead needs LEAD_REOPEN, and a reopened lead goes back to the unassigned queue (its counsellor is cleared, recorded as an UNASSIGNED activity) for reception to reassign. A lead that goes ahead is not closed but converted to a student (planned, S1). The database repeats the key rules as constraints, as a last safety net.

```mermaid

### Lead status lifecycle

The statuses from the PRD and who can move a lead between them. A lead has two endings: CLOSED (lost, with a reason; an admin can reopen it) and CONVERTED (went ahead and became a student; final). CONVERTED is planned (S1, not built yet).

```mermaid

  CONTACTED --> NEW: Admin or Counsellor

  CONVERTED --> [*]: work continues on the Student
```

*Where in the code:* `lead/LeadStatus.java · lead/Lead.java`

<a id="flow-convert"></a>
### Converting a lead to a student (planned, S1)

Not built yet: this is the design proposed to the owner. The counsellor working a lead converts it when the person decides to go ahead. The Student keeps a link to the lead, so the enquiry history stays visible on the student's page. Students follow the same data scope as leads: a counsellor sees their own students, a branch manager the branch's students, and an admin all of them. Still to confirm with the owner: who may convert (proposed: a new LEAD_CONVERT permission for Admin, Branch Manager and Counsellor), the student number format, and the wording of any message to the student.

```mermaid

### Onboarding a staff member

The mobile number is the sign-in identity, so it must be unique within the business. Role and branch must belong to the same business; the database enforces this too.

## Debugging

<a id="dbg-trace"></a>
### Tracing a problem from a request id

Every response carries an `X-Request-Id` header and every error body a `requestId`. That id is on every log line the request produced, including the background notification lines, so one search tells the whole story. Log lines read `LEVEL [request id|tenant id|user id]`; phones and emails are always masked (`+91******3210`, `a***@mail.com`).

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A(["Someone reports: it failed"]) --> B["Get the request id: requestId in the error,<br/>or X-Request-Id in browser dev tools, Network tab"]
  B --> C["Search backend/logs/crm.log for it"]

  D -- "4xx access line" --> E["The line just before names the reason:<br/>validation, permission, not found or out of scope,<br/>conflict, rate limit"]
  D -- "500 with a stack trace" --> F["A bug: the first 'at com.softzenith...' frame<br/>is the file and line to open"]
  D -- "200 or 201, then notification lines" --> G["Follow the background lines with the same id:<br/>Email ... sent, failed or skipped"]
  D -- "nothing at all" --> H["The request never reached the API:<br/>Next.js server, CRM_API_URL, backend down"]
  G --> I["Cross-check the lead page, Messages sent<br/>(notification_log)"]

### What each error code means

Every error is an RFC 9457 problem JSON with `status`, `detail` and `requestId`. The `detail` text is written for people; the log has the technical reason.

| Status | Means | Typical causes | Where it is produced | What to check |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 400 Bad Request | The request is wrong | Missing or invalid field (listed in `detail`); name with digits or a URL; closing a lead without a reason; bad or missing `X-Tenant-ID` for a user in several tenants | `GlobalExceptionHandler`, `StaffContextFilter`, entity rules (`Lead.changeStatus`) | `detail` names the field; log line `400 validation failed: ...` |
| 401 Unauthorized | Not signed in | No token, expired or forged token, wrong issuer (Supabase URL) | Spring Security, `SecurityConfig` entry point | Log `401 GET /path: <reason>`; the staff app clears the session and goes to login |
| 403 Forbidden | Signed in but not allowed | Role lacks the endpoint's permission; not active staff of that tenant; captcha failed on the public form; granting a role stronger than your own | `@PreAuthorize`, `StaffContextFilter`, `PublicEnquiryController`, `StaffAdminService` | Log `403 ...` or `Rejected: subject ...`; compare with the permission matrix |
| 404 Not Found | Nothing to show | Wrong id; record of another tenant; lead outside the user's data scope (BRANCH / OWN); unknown tenant slug | `NotFoundException` from services | Scope first: does the user's role have data_scope ALL? |
| 409 Conflict | Clashes with current data | Phone already used by another staff member; assigning a closed lead; someone else saved the record first (version check); database constraint | `ConflictException`, optimistic lock, integrity violation | Log shows the rule or `constraint=<name>`; reload and retry for concurrent edits |
| 429 Too Many Requests | Slow down | Public form: more than 5 a minute or 30 an hour from one IP, 5 an hour for one phone, 1000 an hour per tenant | `EnquiryRateLimiter` | `Retry-After` header; limits in `crm.public-intake.rate-limit.*` |
| 500 Internal Server Error | A bug or an outage | Unhandled exception, database down | `GlobalExceptionHandler.unexpected` | Log ERROR with the full stack trace under the same request id |

<a id="dbg-runbook"></a>
### Runbook: symptom, cause, fix

Start from what the person sees. Most answers are in the lead page (history and Messages sent), the log for the request id, or one of the SQL queries below.

| Symptom | Likely cause | How to confirm | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| Enquiry submitted but no new lead in the list | Same phone + email already has an open lead, so it was added to that lead as a repeat | Log `Repeat enquiry #n on lead WWV-...`; the older lead has a Repeat badge and sits on top | Nothing to fix: search by phone. Close the old lead to get a new one next time |
| Enquiry submitted but no lead at all | Dropped as a bot (honeypot), refused by rate limit (429) or captcha (403), wrong tenant slug | Log `dropped: honeypot filled`, `429`, `captcha missing or invalid`; the website's `NEXT_PUBLIC_CRM_TENANT` | Correct the slug / captcha keys; wait for the rate limit |
| A lead exists but a user cannot see it | The user's role has data scope BRANCH or OWN | `roles.data_scope` for their role; the lead's branch and assignee | Assign it to them, set the lead's branch, or change the role's scope |
| Website form shows an error, nothing in the CRM log | Website server cannot reach the API | No `crm.access` line for that time; website server output | Set `CRM_API_URL` on the website server; start the backend |
| Welcome email not received | Message FAILED, SKIPPED or never attempted | Lead page, Messages sent: SENT (check spam / Mailpit), FAILED (error shown), SKIPPED (daily cap of 5), none (event still pending) | Fix SMTP settings (`MAIL_*`); pending events are re-sent on restart |
| WhatsApp not received | WhatsApp is demo only | Status DEMO in Messages sent | Expected until the WhatsApp Business API is set up (T7) |
| Staff cannot sign in, 'not registered as staff' | No staff row for that phone in an active tenant, user DISABLED, or the token does not prove an OTP sign-in | `app_users` by `phone_e164`; log `Rejected: subject ...` | Add or enable the staff member; Staff page, Reset sign-in if the identity changed |
| A page shows 'no permission' or a menu item is missing | The role lacks the permission | Permission matrix; `role_permissions` for the role | Grant the permission (DefaultRoles for new tenants + a migration for existing ones) |
| 'Record was modified by someone else' | Two people edited the same lead or staff record | 409 with a version conflict in the log | Reload and apply the change again |
| Same message sent twice | Should not happen: re-delivered events skip messages already logged for that event | `notification_log.event_id` for the lead | Report with the request id; check `NotifierTests` |
| Backend will not start | Postgres not running; a migration changed after it ran (checksum); entity and table disagree (`ddl-auto=validate`); dev login enabled with the prod profile | First ERROR in the console at startup | Start Postgres; never edit an applied migration, add a new V8...; fix the entity or migration |
| Staff app shows type errors or missing fields after an API change | Generated client types are stale | `frontend/lib/api-schema.d.ts` lacks the new field | Run the backend, then `npm run gen:api` in frontend |

### Running it locally

Start in this order; each needs the one before it. Everything runs without cloud accounts: dev login instead of Supabase, Mailpit instead of a real mailbox, demo WhatsApp. Shortcut from the repo root: `.\dev` (restart all), `.\dev stop [-All]`, `.\dev status`. Dev sign-in phones (mock organisation): 9000000001 Anuj (Super Admin, Rohtak), 9000000002 Naman (Branch Manager, Rohini), 9000000003 Natasha (Counsellor, Rohtak), 9000000004 Front Desk (Receptionist), 9000000005 Deepak (Branch Manager, Bahadurgarh), 9000000006 Indu (Counsellor, Rohini), 9000000007 Priya (Counsellor, Bahadurgarh).

| Service | Port | Start | Check |
|---|---|---|---|
| PostgreSQL | 5432 | `"%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\pgsql\bin\pg_ctl" -D "%LOCALAPPDATA%\crm-pgdata" -l "%LOCALAPPDATA%\crm-pgdata\server.log" start` | DB `crm`, user `crm_app` / `crm_app` |
| Mailpit | 1025 SMTP, 8025 inbox | `"%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\mailpit\mailpit.exe"` | Every local email lands at http://localhost:8025 |
| Backend API | 8081 | `cd backend && ./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=dev` | http://localhost:8081/actuator/health, Swagger at `/swagger-ui.html`, log in `backend/logs/crm.log` |
| CRM staff app | 3000 | `cd frontend && npm run dev` (or `npm run build` then `npx next start -p 3000`) | http://localhost:3000/login |
| Western World website (own repo) | 3001 | `cd ../westernworld-website && npm run dev -- -p 3001`, or list it in `.dev-sites.json` for `.\dev` | http://localhost:3001 |
| Backend tests | none | `cd backend && ./mvnw test` (embedded Postgres + GreenMail, no Docker) | Must be green before a task is done |

### Settings that change behaviour

Environment variables for deployment and the `application.yml` keys worth knowing when debugging. Local development needs none of the variables; with the `prod` profile the database and Supabase ones are required.

| Setting | Where | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DB_URL`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD` | backend | local crm / crm_app | Database connection (required in prod) |
| `SUPABASE_URL` | backend | placeholder | Issuer and signing keys of staff sign-in tokens (required in prod) |
| `MAIL_HOST`, `MAIL_PORT`, `MAIL_USERNAME`, `MAIL_PASSWORD`, `MAIL_FROM` | backend | Mailpit on localhost:1025 | Where emails go and who they come from |
| `FRONTEND_URL` | backend | http://localhost:3000 | Links to leads inside staff emails |
| `TURNSTILE_SECRET` | backend | empty (no captcha) | Captcha required on public enquiries when set |
| `LOG_FILE` | backend | logs/crm.log | Log file path (20 MB files, 30 days, 2 GB cap) |
| `crm.public-intake.rate-limit.*` | application.yml | 5/min and 30/h per IP, 5/h per phone, 1000/h per tenant | Public form limits, answered with 429 |
| `crm.notifications.enquirer-daily-cap` | application.yml | 5 | Messages of one kind to one enquirer per 24 h; the rest are logged SKIPPED |
| `logging.level.com.softzenith.crm` | application.yml | info (debug in dev) | More detail; add `logging.level.org.hibernate.SQL=debug` to see SQL |
| `CRM_API_URL` | both front ends | http://localhost:8081 | Where the Next.js server forwards API calls |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | staff app | empty (dev login) | Phone OTP sign-in |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CRM_TENANT` | website | westernworld | Tenant that receives the website's enquiries |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` | both front ends | empty | Shows the captcha widget on enquiry forms |

### Useful database queries

Run in psql or any SQL client against the `crm` database. Direct SQL is not tenant-filtered, so these see every tenant: filter by `tenant_id` when it matters. Read only; change data through the app so history and events stay correct.

```
-- A lead, its history and every message sent for it
select id, lead_number, status, enquiry_count, last_enquiry_at, assigned_to, branch_id
  from leads where lead_number = 'WWV-000009';
select created_at, type, from_value, to_value, note
  from lead_activities where lead_id = (select id from leads where lead_number = 'WWV-000009') order by created_at;
select created_at, channel, kind, recipient, status, error, event_id
  from notification_log where lead_id = (select id from leads where lead_number = 'WWV-000009') order by created_at;

-- Find leads by phone (stored as E.164)
select lead_number, full_name, status, created_at from leads where phone_e164 = '+919876543210' order by created_at;

-- Events not delivered yet (notifications pending or failing); re-sent on restart
select publication_date, event_type, listener_id, completion_attempts
  from event_publication where completion_date is null order by publication_date;

-- A staff member: status, role, scope and permissions
select u.full_name, u.phone_e164, u.status, r.name as role, r.data_scope, string_agg(rp.permission, ', ') as permissions
  from app_users u join roles r on r.id = u.role_id left join role_permissions rp on rp.role_id = r.id
 where u.phone_e164 = '+919000000003'
 group by u.full_name, u.phone_e164, u.status, r.name, r.data_scope;

-- Messages skipped or failed today
select created_at, kind, recipient, status, error from notification_log
 where status in ('FAILED', 'SKIPPED') and created_at > now() - interval '1 day' order by created_at desc;
```
